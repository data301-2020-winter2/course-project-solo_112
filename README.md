## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The NFL Scouting Combine is a week-long showcase where college football players perform various athletic tests in front of NFL coaches, general managers and scouts. Athletes can only attend if they have been invited. The NFL is a business and drafting the right player can make or break a franchise. I am interested as to why some players like Tom Brady (the GOAT) is drafted 199th overall in the 6th round of 2000 whereas Robert Griffin III is picked 2nd overall in 2012 and only started for two seasons.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

My dataset contains the name, position, height and weight of all players invited to the NFL Combine from 2000 until 2018. The data also includes results of six athletic tests. Finally, the data includes what team, round and overall pick the athlete was selected in the draft if any.

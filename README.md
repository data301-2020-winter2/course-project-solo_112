## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The NFL Scouting Combine is a week-long showcase where college football players perform various athletic tests in front of NFL coaches, general managers and scouts. Athletes can only attend if they have been invited. The NFL is a business and drafting the right player can make or break a franchise. The combine has been broadcast on television since 2004. In 2010 combine broadcast on the NFL Network received 5.24 million viewers. In 2019 ESPN began providing additional coverage. These players are amazingly talented athletes, it is entertaining to watch what the human body is capable of. I enjoy watching football, to me football is like a modern gladiator match mixed with chess-like strategy. The players at the combine are future stars of the NFL. My big question is why some players like Tom Brady (the GOAT - Greatest Of All Time) get drafted 199th overall in the 6th round of the 2000 draft whereas Robert Griffin III get picked 2nd overall in 2012 and only started for two seasons; was this decision based on their combine performance?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

My dataset contains the name, position, height and weight of all players invited to the NFL Combine from 2000 until 2018. The data also includes results of six athletic tests: 40 yard dash time, number of bench press repetitions with 225 pounds, broad jump length, 3-cone drill test, and shuttle run time. These are comprehensive tests that measure muscle strength and stamina, speed, agility, change of direction, body control Finally, the data includes what team, round and overall pick the athlete was selected in the draft if any. The data was collected by the National Football League during the scouting combine in the respective year. The data represents a subset of the measurements collected at the combine. For example, hand size, arm length and wingspan are not part of the dataset. The data is collected and measured by humans using the appropriate measurement tools. The combine data is used by NFL teams to help inform draft picks.
